    <h2>Migratory Bird Patterns</h2>
    <p>Birds can reach great heights as they migrate.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">

    <p>Bar-headed geese are the highest-flying migratory birds,
     regularly reaching altitudes of up to five and a half miles above sea level while flying over the Himalayas in India. But the bird with the record for the highest altitude ever is the Ruppel’s griffon vulture, which collided with a plane at 37,000 feet (that’s seven miles!) in 1975 and was unfortunately sucked into its jet engine.</p>
    <p>The Arctic tern has the longest migration of any bird in the world.
      These black-capped, red-billed birds can fly more than 49,700 miles in a year,
      making a round trip between their breeding grounds in the Arctic and the Antarctic,
      where they spend their winters. The lucky bird gets to see two summers a year!
      And over its lifespan of more than 30 years,
      the flights can add up to the equivalent of three trips to the moon and back.</p>
